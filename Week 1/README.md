# **Welcome to Week 1 of Data DaVinci**

This week, we’ll dive into Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Genetic Algorithms.  
Along the way, we’ll also spend some time learning about different techniques to help avoid overfitting and make our models more effective.

This Week has 3 Assignments (all related data will be in the same directory)
