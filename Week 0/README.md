# **Welcome to Week 0 of Data DaVinci**

In this week we will cover the basics of python and a few libraries namely NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn that are required to learn core concepts in ML.

This week's assignments are divided into 3 parts

- [Python Basics](./Python%20Basics/)
- [Python Libraries](./Python%20Libraries/)
- [Assignment](./Assignment/)

To get started, although not required, it is very helpful to understand how Jupyter Notebooks, Github and VS Code works.  
Also it is highly reccomended that you set up a virtual environment for Python and work on Ubuntu 24.04.
